## Overview

So far so good, today we are going to work on a dataset which consists information about the location of the house, price and other aspects such as square feet etc. When we work on these sorts of data, we need to see which column is important for us and which is not. Our main aim today is to make a model which can give us a good prediction on the price of the house based on other variables. We are going to use Linear Regression for this dataset and see if it gives us a good accuracy or not.

In this Blog we are going to do implementing a salable model for predicting the house price prediction using some of the regression techniques based of some of features in the dataset which is called Boston House Price Prediction. There are some of the processing techniques for creating a model. We will see about it in upcoming parts …

## Motivation

The Motivation behind it I just wanna know about the house prices in California as well as I’ve an idea about to do some of the useful things do in the lock down period. I think this is a limited motivation for doing this blog well.
