## Overview ##
This is a simple **Classification** project where we can able to do the classifying the **Iris flowers**. 
Create the Machine Learning model that can classify the different species of the Iris flower.

## Motivation ##
What could be a perfect way to utilize unfortunate lockdown period? Like most of you, I spend my time Gardening, Games, Movies, Coding and read some stories as well as read some of the trending AI Papers through the Google. When i heard about the Iris Flowers Classification i could find my own interset to making this model. So i retrive the dataset form kaggle and making this idea come true.

## Installation ##
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed just [clik here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install python on your system. 
If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and sklearn.

## About the Data ##
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper the use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an exampleof linear discriminant analysis.His contribution to statistics is way beyond the Fisher's exact test. For example, he developedthe maximum likelihood estimation and the analysis of variance (more commonly known as its acronym ANOVA) test.If you wanna get this data set just [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/arshid/iris-flower-dataset) and you will get it. For these important contributions, he has been highly regarded in the history of modern statistics, as noted on his Wikipedia page.
